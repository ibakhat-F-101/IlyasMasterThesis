- Pre-meeting
	- to discuss
		- problem with dotenv ruby gem that vagrant-env uses
			- https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/13550
		- problem with changes made to the invoiceninja repository that make it no longer work
		- problem with molecule test that fails because of outdated docker_compose (migrate to docker_compose_v2, but docker_compose_v2 is not found by ansible)
			- current solution: using shell module to execute docker compose
		- production server (future)
		- looking for a jury process
		- where to put meeting notes
- Meeting Notes
	- Take a look at wiki for putting the meeting notes
		- make sure the wiki is clonable, be carefule not to break it
	- Vagrant-env can be removed, it is not essential
	- Using ansible -> should try to use modules as much as possible, avoid shell
	- Jury selection
		- Try as soon as possible
		- As soon as possible means when you have a workable draft
		- 3 people (including promotor) in the jury
			- but think about a list of 5 so that you can move on to the next if negative answer
			- do NOT contact jury too late (e.g. june/july, it will be for next year then)
			- ideally February/March
	- For overleaf repository
		- send message to professor via mattermost
	- Thesis review
		- send as soon as possible something that has been pushed as far as you can
			- not perfect, but as far as you can go yourself
			- for example not something that hasn't even been spell checked
		- send smallest possible chapter
			- to get remarks asap
		- house rules
			- professor has limited time to review
			- inform what the time should be spent on (e.g. which page has been changed)
			- not last minute
	- Technical side of the thesis project
		- collaboration but each student needs to have an individual contribution
		- not necessarily an issue with no technical component to social engineering subject
			- but a jury will not be happy
			- so technical component is necessary (e.g. an implementation)
		- what to avoid
			- after the jury listens to you, they should not be able to find a better solution than you on the spot
			- not just an implementation, but at least some form of scientific advancement
	- Use gitlab issues plenty even if you work on them right after creating them
	- 3-servers production
		- red-black methodology
		- hardened version should be essentially a private cloud
	-
- Post-meeting
	- To do for the repo
		- merge fixes into main
		- add issues
			- get docker_compose_v2 working instead of shell module in ansible
			- remove vagrant-env plugin due to its issues
		- add current contributors & focus
