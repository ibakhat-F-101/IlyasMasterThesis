# Cybersecurity Risk Management Strategy

This document defines our organization’s strategy to manage cybersecurity risks. It aligns with CyFun ID.GV-4 requirements and supports continuous improvement.

## 1. Objectives

- Protect our critical assets (client data, credentials, accounting systems).
- Integrate risk management into company governance.
- Make decisions based on real risks and business impact.
- Allocate the right resources (time, budget, people) to protect what matters.

## 2. Governance Integration

Cybersecurity risk management is part of our overall risk management process.

- The **Directive Manager** is responsible for approving the strategy.
- All staff (accountants, secretary, external IT) participate in risk identification.
- Risks are reviewed during management meetings and documented in the Risk Register.

## 3. Risk Identification and Evaluation

We use the CyFun framework to identify risks across these areas:

- Infrastructure and physical assets (ID.AM-1)
- Software and platforms (ID.AM-2)
- Information and data flows (ID.AM-3)
- Vulnerabilities (ID.RA-1)
- Threats and risk scenarios (ID.RA-5)

Risks are evaluated using a simple matrix (impact × probability). High risks are treated first.

## 4. Risk Treatment and Action Plans

For each identified risk:

- We check what protections are already in place.
- We define new actions when needed (e.g. training, backup, patching).
- We assign owners and deadlines.

All actions are recorded in our **Risk Management Plan** (see `risk_management_plan.md`).

## 5. Resource Planning

The Directive Manager ensures that we have the necessary resources to apply protections:

- Human resources: clear roles and responsibilities
- Financial resources: small yearly budget for training, backup, and support
- Technical tools: use of free/open-source tools where possible (e.g. Trivy scanner)

## 6. Review Process

We review this strategy:

- Once per year
- After any serious incident or major change (new client, new software, etc.)

Each review is documented with date and summary of changes.

## 7. Improvement Path

This strategy will evolve. We aim to:

- Add automation where possible
- Include employees more in the risk process
- Align progressively with ISO 27001 and NIS2 expectations
