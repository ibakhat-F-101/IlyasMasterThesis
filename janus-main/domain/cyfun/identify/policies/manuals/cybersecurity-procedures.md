# Cybersecurity Procedures

These procedures support the **Cybersecurity Policy** (see `cybersecurity-policy.md`) and ensure the firm stays compliant with **ID.GV-1**. They apply to the directive manager, accountants, secretary, and any external IT provider.

---

## 1. Policy Creation & Approval

1. **Drafting**  
   - Directive manager writes or updates `cybersecurity-policy.md`.  
   - Use existing checklists (e.g. `checklist-ID.AM-1.md`, `checklist-ID.AM-2.md`) as inputs for scope and controls.

2. **Review by External IT**  
   - Send draft to external IT partner for technical feedback (network, encryption, backups).  
   - Incorporate their comments into the policy document.

3. **Final Approval**  

   - Directive manager approves the final draft.  

## 2. Communication & Distribution

1. **Internal Posting**  
   - Copy `cybersecurity-policy.md` and `cybersecurity-procedures.md` to shared folder or intranet.  
   - Place a PDF version in the office common area (print or digital display).

2. **Email Notification**  
   - Directive manager emails all staff whenever policy or procedures change.  
   - Email must include:  
     - Summary of changes  
     - Link to updated files  
     - Deadline to acknowledge receipt (e.g. “Please confirm by reply before YYYY-MM-DD”).

3. **Acknowledgement Tracking**  

   - Use a simple Google Form or spreadsheet.  
   - Each employee (accountant, secretary) signs off with name, date, and policy version.

## 3. Onboarding & Training

1. **New Hires**  

   - During onboarding, the secretary shares:  
     - `cybersecurity-policy.md`  
     - `cybersecurity-procedures.md`
     - `legal_compliance.md`  

2. **Training Session** 

   - External IT delivers a short (30-minute) walkthrough of key points:  
     - Password rules  
     - Data classification  
     - Incident reporting steps  

3. **Annual Refresh**  

   - Once per year, schedule a team meeting:  
     - Review main policy points  
     - Highlight any changes  
     - Update acknowledgement list  

## 4. Review & Update Cycle

1. **Scheduled Review**  

   - Every 12 months, directive manager runs a reminder (e.g., calendar invite or automated task).  
   - Review includes:  
     - Policy text (`cybersecurity-policy.md`)  
     - Procedures (`cybersecurity-procedures.md`)  
     - All checklists (ID.AM-1 through ID.RA)

2. **Triggering Events**  

   - Any major change in software (new SaaS platform)  
   - Change of external IT provider  
   - A security incident or audit finding  

3. **Revision Process**  

   - Directive manager drafts updates.  
   - External IT reviews technical sections.  
   - Approval as per Step 1.  

4. **Version Tracking**  

   - Maintain a simple table at the end of each document:

   | Date       | Author            | Change Summary                 |
   | ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
   | YYYY-MM-DD | Directive Manager | First release                  |


## 5. Incident Response Alignment

- In case of a reported incident (see Policy 2.4), (TODO_CYFUN : follow the firm’s **Incident Response Guide**).  
- Update both policy and procedures afterward to reflect lessons learned.
