##  Purpose

This YAML file describes the **types of information** stored or used by the organization, along with:
- Where the data is stored (tools, SaaS, internal services)
- Who accesses it
- How it is exchanged or transmitted
- Its criticality level

##  File location

`/domain/cyfun/identify/information/assets_information.yml`

This file is versioned with the infrastructure and can be updated manually or semi-automatically.
