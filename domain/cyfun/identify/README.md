This folder contains everything needed to help a small company become **compliant with the CyFun Identify function** at the **Basic level**.

It includes playbooks, manual templates, checklists, and policies for all Identify sub-functions:

* **ID.RA-1** â€“ Identification of vulnerabilities
* **ID.RA-5** â€“ Risk modeling and assessment
* **ID.GV-1 / ID.GV-3 / ID.GV-4** â€“ Governance, legal, and risk policies

## What this folder provides

For each CyFun sub-function:

* One or more Ansible **playbooks** (for automated tasks)
* One or more **manual YAML files** (to complete manually when automation is not possible)
* A **checklist** file to make sure all expected steps are done
* (If needed) a **policy** or procedure to support organizational compliance

## ðŸ›  How to use (Simple Steps)

1. Run the infrastructure using Vagrant:

```bash
USE_CYFUN=true vagrant up
```

2. After launch, automated playbooks will generate output files inside `output/` folders. Examples:

* `/domain/cyfun/identify/assets/output/assets.yml`
* `/domain/cyfun/identify/software/output/assets_software.yml`

3. Open and complete the **manual** files:

* `manual-assets.yml` â†’ for printers, mobile phones, etc.
* `manual_software.yml` â†’ for SaaS and tools not installed inside JANUS
* `assets_information.yml` â†’ to describe types of data used and how they are shared
* `manual-risks.yml` â†’ to describe risks combining threats, vulnerabilities, and assets

4. Use the **checklists** to make sure you are compliant:

* Each checklist (e.g. `checklist-ID.AM-1.md`) tells you exactly what must be done
* Check all boxes (`[x]`) before considering a sub-function as compliant

5. Policies (in `policies/`) and procedures must be:

* Written (already provided)
* Approved (add a signature if needed)
* Shared with the team (by email)

## ðŸ§¾ Final note

This Identify module is adapted to SMEs. It combines:

* Full automation where possible
